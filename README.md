# YourSweeper


In my Compp (Computural Perception) class, I took on the challenge of creating a Minesweeper game from scratch, without relying on any libraries. It was a thrilling experience to code every detail of the game, from the board layout to the logic behind marking or revealing squares.

But that was just the beginning. I wanted to take things further by creating an AI that could play Minesweeper on its own. To achieve this, I turned to the ConvNetJS library in Javascript and implemented a Reinforcement Learning approach.

Unfortunately, my AI is not yet a master at avoiding mines. It's still learning and makes some costly mistakes. One factor that might be hindering its performance is that I only gave it the board as input and didn't explain the game's rules. So, it's trying to figure out everything on its own. Nevertheless, I'm excited to keep working on it and see how much it can improve with time.
